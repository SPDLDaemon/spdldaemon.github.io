                    This section describes the system for our atoll capture vehicle (ACV), i.e., our boat.  The design requirements 
										for the ACV were to:
										<ol>
											<li>
												Navigate the fountain under wireless control
											</li>
											<li>
												Capture atolls by reading their RFID cards and broadcasting those serials in a packet
											</li>
											<li>
												Receive a team color assignment from team RFID cards and electromechanically display that color on the ACV
											</li>
											<li>
												Upon team color assignment, initiate wireless communication using a class-determined communications protocol 
												to find other boats on your team and establish that you are teammates with them
											</li>
										<ol>
										We divided the functions of our ACV into six separate microcontrollers and had them share information via UART 
										and SPI protocols.  Although this is less efficient than using a single microcontroller for all tasks, this 
										allowed us to learn more about networking while satisfying the requirements of the project.
									</p>
									<p>
										Referring to the system map below, we have six individual PIC16F690’s on our ACV, each performing unique tasks.  
										The diagram shows what other devices each PIC talks to and which communication protocols they use.

                  <p><b>Master PIC.</b>  The master PIC is the master on the SPI system.  All other chips on that network are slaves.  
									The master PIC receives RFID serials from the RFID PIC and determines whether they belong to an atoll or a team 
									color card.  If the serials belong to an atoll, the master PIC sends them to the security controller via UART to 
									retrieve the security keys necessary for capturing an atoll.  The security controller was provided to us by the 
									teaching team, and we communicate with it via a professor-determined protocol.  Once the master PIC has the atoll 
									serials and security keys or just the team color serials, it sends them to the XBee PIC via SPI using a 
									team-determined protocol.
                  </p>
                  <p><b>XBee PIC.</b>  The XBee PIC receives and sends messages to the XBee wireless transceiver via UART, and it 
									also receives messages from the master PIC via SPI.   If the XBee PIC receives team color serials from the master 
									PIC, initiates the class-determined communication sequence to find other boats on the same team.   Once a teammate 
									has been found, the XBee pic turns on one of the team color fans by raising a logic pin tied to a MOSFET.  The 
									fans blow around colored packing peanuts.If the XBee PIC receives atoll serials and security keys from the master 
									PIC, it wirelessly broadcasts that information using a class-determined protocol to capture the atoll.
                  </p>
									<p><b>Motor PICs.</b>  The motor PICs also receive messages from the XBee transceiver via UART.  They are looking 
									specifically for speed commands from the remote control.   When they have received the appropriate message, they 
									update the PWM signal that they are sending to the motor H-bridges.  Each motor PIC runs the same code, but 
									determines whether it controls the right or the left motor via an address line that is tied high or low.
                  </p>
									<p><b>XBee.</b>  The XBee itself is an RF transceiver.   The chip comes with the hardware layer and the low level 
									sending and receiving software layers prebuilt.  As a class, we designed a wireless communications protocol at 
									the packet level to allow multiple teams to control their boats, capture atolls, and establish teammates 
									without interfering with each other.

										To ensure we do not burn out our H-Bridge, it was important to check the most current it will ever have to source is within spec.
										While no datasheet was available for the motors that drove our propellers, we measured the current at 
										various loads.  Under a typical load they drew about 1A and when stalled they drew about 2A. Our H-Bridge, 
										an LMD18200, can deliver 3A so our factor of safety from toasting our H-bridge is:

									All of our logic circuits require 5V, but our batteries supply 7.2V each.  Thus we use voltage regulators on

									current capabilities (1A).  Although 1A current is excessive for our application, we wanted to maintain the 
									option of adding more LEDs later on in the project.  We did not want to be limited by the 100 mA current
