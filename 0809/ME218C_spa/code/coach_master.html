Else this direction.

UPDATE_DISPLAYS:
  clear boat display register
  clear morale1 display register
  clear negative and ten's digit bits of morale2 display register

  Else load the boat ID
  call	DISP_TABLE - look up the display byte
  save in boat_disp

  check if displaying morale is appropriate
  If no morale...
    ...skip loading morale display.
  If yes,
    store 10 in temp for comparison later
    load the morale
    If positive......continue.
      Else make positive and set negative sign bit
    Check if absolute value of morale is 10
